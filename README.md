# Assignment-
importing libraries
for test image
1) matplotlib.pyplot as plt - to creates a plotting figure
2) matplotlib.image as mpim - to read images and display the images

data1 image - read image which downloads from web 

data2 image - read image which downloads from web

display the image using plot show

3)importing cv2 which loads an image from the specified file

4)Euclidean Distace between data1 and test is to Find the Euclidean Distance Between Two Points.

5)Prerequisites: Python OpenCV. Suppose we have two data images and a test image

6)Importing image data. image = cv2.imread('test.jpg')

7)Converting to gray image. gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

8)Finding Histogram. ...

9)Example: ...

10)data2.jpg.

11)test.jpg

12)Final Output
